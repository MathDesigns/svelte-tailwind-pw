      <h2 class="drop-shadow-md text-blueish text-3xl">Where it started</h2>
      <p>
        As far as I can remember, I always tried to find the most lazy but still optimal way to do things.
        That's where software development kicked in: creating solutions for my very own problems
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="rounded-md px-4 py-4 m-8 w-80 shadow-md bg-light-back hover:bg-white">
      <h2 class="drop-shadow-md text-blueish text-3xl">Now ATM</h2>
      <p>
        Okay, now that the desire to develop was there, I had to develop some skills in order to satisfy any of my needs.
        This led me to a software development studies, which im is still following as of today in HELMo Campus Guillemins, which is located in Li√®ge, Belgium.

      <h2 class="drop-shadow-md text-blueish text-3xl">What's coming</h2>
      <p>
        So let's resume, lazy but in a good way, what does it even mean ? Developing solutions just to satisfy my laziness can't be a life goal right ?
        Yes, indeed, that's why i'm aiming to join ethical organizations to share my knowledge and provide solutions that can help people.
        That will be my contribution in the transition to make the world a better place to live.
